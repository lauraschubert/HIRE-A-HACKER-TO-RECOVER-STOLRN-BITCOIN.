I had over $400k in Bitcoin lost to a fake investor online that I came across last year through a colleague of mine at work who also lost her investment along the line. However, she had been investing with the company for months and had been paid out severally before this happened, tried reaching the support team but did not get any feedback for several weeks, at some point I thought about getting a hacker to see if that would help. Then I read about a team â€œCalled FASTFUND RECOVERY(FASTFUNDRECOVERY8 (@)GMAIL COM ) which helped people retrieve their lost funds in investment or even stolen from their bank accounts, I reached out to him without hesitating and the outcome was wonderful, and after retrieving the whole money he also worked for my colleague and is in the final stage of retrieving the last investment she made. If you ever find yourself in such a situation there's hope for you to get your money recovered back to you. Web. Fastfundrecovery dot com. w/a, 1.8.0.7.5.0.0.7.5.5.4
